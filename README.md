##Mini Hype Machine Chrome Extension
by Mark Dunphy (@misterdunphy)

This extension for Google Chrome allows you to control hypem.com from any tab/window.

Here's some things you can do:

* Favorite
* Pause/Play
* Skip/Go back
* Read the blog post
* View track/artist information

Note:  There are a lot of comments and things that take up a lot of space in the code.  The scripts are all minified before going live so they're removed in full versions.  These are the pretty/well documented versions on GitHub.
